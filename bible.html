            <h2>Romans 7:19-20</h2>
            <p>For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Colossians 1:10</h2>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Mark 11:23</h2>
            <p>Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>1 Corinthians 6:18</h2>

        <section>
            <h2>Mark 9:43</h2>
            <p>And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Ecclesiastes 7:15</h2>
