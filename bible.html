        <h2>Bible Verses</h2>
        <p>Here are some of my favorite Bible verses (ESV):</p>

        <div class="verse">
            <h3>Romans 7:19-22</h3>
            <p>For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. ... For I delight in the law of God in my inner being, but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <h3>Colossians 1:10</h3>
            <p>So as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <h3>James 2:10</h3>
            <p>For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <h3>Proverbs 18:24</h3>
            <p>A man of many companions may come to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <h3>Mark 11:23</h3>
            <p>Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <h3>1 Corinthians 6:18</h3>
            <p>Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <h3>Mark 9:43</h3>
            <p>And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <h3>Ecclesiastes 7:15</h3>
            <p>In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these: the righteous perishing in their righteousness, and the wicked living long in their wickedness.</p>
