      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Aberdeen, South Dakota, and have lived there my entire life. Growing up in a close-knit community has helped me appreciate the value of consistency, character, and faith. Aberdeen has shaped how I view hard work and loyalty — traits that carry over into everything I do. It’s a place that taught me to stay humble while always striving for more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I attend Trinity Bible College & Graduate School, where I’m pursuing my Master’s in Business Administration. The program has challenged me to think critically about leadership, stewardship, and the balance between innovation and ethics. It’s also taught me the importance of leading with integrity, no matter the setting. I’m learning how to use business as a tool to create real, lasting impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of my greatest strengths in today’s workforce is my proficiency with Artificial Intelligence. I’ve learned how to integrate AI tools into projects, streamlining tasks and increasing efficiency without losing the human touch that makes good work meaningful. Using technology responsibly is something I take pride in. It’s not just about automation — it’s about enhancing creativity and purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of academics, basketball plays a huge role in my life. I train regularly as a member of the college basketball team and also compete on the soccer team. Sports have taught me the importance of discipline, teamwork, and resilience. Every practice and game has shaped how I handle pressure and stay focused on growth both on and off the court.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond the court, I have a growing passion for understanding the stock market. My long-term goal is to become fluent in trading and investment strategies, not just for personal growth but to help others build financial literacy and independence. Learning how to make smart financial moves is something I believe can change lives. It’s a journey I’m excited to keep building on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Family means a lot to me — I have two brothers, a half-sister, and a dog named Leo who has more energy than anyone else in the house. They keep me grounded, and I’m grateful for every bit of chaos they bring. No matter where I go, that sense of home and support stays with me. It’s what keeps me centered and focused.
      </p>

      <p>
        Someone who inspires me deeply is Stephen Curry. His openness about his Christian faith, even on the biggest stage, reminds me that success doesn’t mean hiding what you believe in — it means standing firm in it. He represents confidence without arrogance and faith without fear. That’s the kind of example I try to live by.
      </p>

      <p>
        My faith is the foundation of everything I do. I’m a devoted Christian and an active member of Bethlehem Lutheran, where I’ve found a strong community that supports both spiritual and personal growth. Faith keeps me steady through every challenge and reminds me who’s in control. It’s what drives me to stay grateful, even in uncertainty.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the future, I hope to combine my skills in business, technology, and faith to make a meaningful impact — whether through entrepreneurship, mentorship, or service. I believe purpose and progress go hand in hand. Every step I take is guided by the hope of using what I’ve learned to help others grow too. That’s the vision that keeps me moving forward.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every day, I try to live with gratitude and intention — learning, leading, and trusting that where I’m headed is exactly where I’m meant to be. I know that the work I’m putting in now is building something bigger than myself. Faith and effort will always lead me where I need to go. That’s what keeps me grounded and motivated.
