        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am from Aberdeen, SD, and have lived there my entire life. Currently, I am attending Trinity Bible College & Graduate School, hoping to attain my Master's in Business Administration.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my biggest skills that will translate to the workforce today is my proficiency with Artificial Intelligence. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and soccer. I’m on both teams here, and training is a big part of my routine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Long-term goals include fully understanding the stock market and trading. Fun facts about me: I have two brothers, a half-sister, and a dog named Leo. Someone I find very inspiring is Stephen Curry, particularly how openly he shares his Christian faith.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a devoted Christian and regularly attend Bethlehem Lutheran. My faith guides me in both personal and professional aspects of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Basketball has taught me discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. Soccer complements my athletic training and provides balance to my routine.
        </p>
        <p>
            In academics, I focus on both theory and practical applications of business and technology. Using AI effectively is a core strength I hope to leverage in future career opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy reading and reflecting on scripture. My favorite verses guide my values and daily decisions, shaping both my personal and professional character.
        </p>
        <p>
            Community involvement and mentorship are important to me. I aim to inspire others through leadership, collaboration, and integrity.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am continually exploring new ways to learn and grow, whether through sports, studies, or creative projects. Each experience builds toward my long-term vision.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I strive to combine faith, education, and personal passions to contribute positively to the world around me.
