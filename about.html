        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am from Aberdeen, SD, and I have lived here my entire life. My community and upbringing have shaped the person I am today, instilling in me a sense of responsibility and dedication.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am attending Trinity Bible College & Graduate School, pursuing my Master's in Business Administration. My education is focused on equipping me with the skills necessary to thrive in both the professional and personal aspects of life.</p>
        <p>One of my key strengths is my proficiency with Artificial Intelligence, which I have developed through both academic studies and personal exploration. I enjoy applying AI concepts in practical situations, which I believe is a highly valuable skill in today’s workforce.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I am actively involved in sports. I play basketball and soccer for my college teams, dedicating myself to training and teamwork. These activities help me maintain discipline, resilience, and a strong work ethic.</p>
        <p>My long-term goals include gaining a deep understanding of the stock market and trading strategies. I am passionate about investing and continuously educate myself to make informed financial decisions.</p>
        <p>On a personal level, I come from a family with two brothers, a half-sister, and a dog named Leo. Family life and relationships are very important to me, shaping my values and guiding my daily decisions.</p>
        <p>I find inspiration in individuals who combine talent with integrity. Stephen Curry, for example, impresses me with his transparency and devotion to his Christian faith, which motivates me to integrate my faith with my ambitions.</p>
        <p>My faith is central to my life. I am a devoted Christian and regularly attend Bethlehem Lutheran Church. My faith informs my values, decisions, and interactions with others, providing guidance and purpose.</p>
        <p>In all aspects of life, I strive for balance — combining education, sports, faith, family, and personal growth. Each area complements the other, helping me become a well-rounded individual.</p>
        <p>Overall, I am committed to lifelong learning, personal development, and meaningful engagement with my community. I aim to live a life that reflects my principles and ambitions while remaining grounded in faith and family.</p>
