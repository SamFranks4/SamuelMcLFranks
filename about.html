    <section>
      <p>I was born and raised in Aberdeen, South Dakota, where I have spent my entire life. My hometown has shaped much of who I am today, instilling values of community, perseverance, and faith.</p>

      <p>Currently, I am pursuing my higher education at Trinity Bible College & Graduate School, working toward a Master's in Business Administration. This journey allows me to combine my passion for learning with practical skills that prepare me for the workforce.</p>

      <p>One of my strongest skills is proficiency with Artificial Intelligence, a field I have studied and applied extensively. I am particularly interested in how AI can enhance decision-making, streamline processes, and transform the way businesses operate.</p>

      <p>Outside of academics, I am actively involved in sports. I play both basketball and soccer, dedicating time to training and team activities. These experiences not only keep me physically active but also teach discipline, teamwork, and leadership.</p>

      <p>My long-term goals include gaining a deep understanding of the stock market and trading. I am fascinated by the mechanics of investing and the challenge of making informed, strategic financial decisions.</p>

      <p>On a more personal note, my family is a central part of my life. I have two brothers, a half-sister, and a dog named Leo. Spending time with them reminds me of the importance of balance, laughter, and loyalty.</p>

      <p>I draw inspiration from figures like Stephen Curry, whose openness about his Christian faith demonstrates courage and authenticity. His example encourages me to integrate my beliefs into all aspects of my life.</p>

      <p>Speaking of faith, I am a devoted Christian and an active member of Bethlehem Lutheran Church. My spiritual life grounds me, giving perspective, purpose, and a strong moral compass.</p>

      <p>I strive to approach life with integrity, compassion, and a willingness to learn. These principles guide both my personal and professional endeavors, helping me build meaningful relationships and make thoughtful decisions.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, I hope this page offers a glimpse into who I am‚Äîsomeone driven, curious, and committed to growth. Whether through academics, sports, or faith, I aim to make a positive impact and leave a lasting impression on those around me.</p>
