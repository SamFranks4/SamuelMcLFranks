      <p>
        I was born and raised in Aberdeen, South Dakota, and have lived there my entire life.
        Growing up in a close-knit community has helped me appreciate the value of consistency,
        character, and faith.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I attend Trinity Bible College & Graduate School, where I’m pursuing my Master’s
        in Business Administration. The program has challenged me to think critically about
        leadership, stewardship, and the balance between innovation and ethics.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of my greatest strengths in today’s workforce is my proficiency with Artificial Intelligence.
        I’ve learned how to integrate AI tools into projects, streamlining tasks and increasing efficiency
        without losing the human touch that makes good work meaningful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of academics, basketball plays a huge role in my life. I train regularly as a member of the
        college basketball team and also compete on the soccer team. Sports have taught me the importance
        of discipline, teamwork, and resilience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond the court, I have a growing passion for understanding the stock market. My long-term goal is to
        become fluent in trading and investment strategies, not just for personal growth but to help others
        build financial literacy and independence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Family means a lot to me — I have two brothers, a half-sister, and a dog named Leo who has more energy
        than anyone else in the house. They keep me grounded, and I’m grateful for every bit of chaos they bring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Someone who inspires me deeply is Stephen Curry. His openness about his Christian faith, even on the biggest
        stage, reminds me that success doesn’t mean hiding what you believe in — it means standing firm in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        My faith is the foundation of everything I do. I’m a devoted Christian and an active member of Bethlehem
        Lutheran, where I’ve found a strong community that supports both spiritual and personal growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the future, I hope to combine my skills in business, technology, and faith to make a meaningful impact —
        whether through entrepreneurship, mentorship, or service. I believe purpose and progress go hand in hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every day, I try to live with gratitude and intention — learning, leading, and trusting that where I’m headed
        is exactly where I’m meant to be.
