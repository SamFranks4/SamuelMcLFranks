      <p>
        I was born and raised in Aberdeen, South Dakota, a place that has shaped my sense of identity and values.
        Growing up in a close-knit community has taught me the importance of faith, consistency, and integrity in everything I do.
        Whether it’s on the court, in the classroom, or at home, those small-town roots continue to guide me in staying grounded.
        I take pride in where I come from, and I carry that same humility and focus into every part of my life.
      </p>

      <p>
        I currently attend Trinity Bible College & Graduate School, where I’m pursuing my Master’s in Business Administration.
        The coursework has challenged me to think critically about leadership and the balance between faith and ambition.
        I’ve come to understand that business isn’t just about numbers and strategy — it’s about people, purpose, and stewardship.
        My studies are helping me develop both a professional skill set and a personal sense of calling for where I want to go next.
      </p>

      <p>
        In today’s world, technology plays a massive role in success, and one of my biggest strengths is my understanding of Artificial Intelligence.
        I’ve spent time learning how to use AI in productive ways — tools that make work more efficient while keeping creativity and authenticity intact.
        It’s been eye-opening to see how AI can support real human growth rather than replace it.
        My goal is to keep mastering this skill set so I can use it responsibly and help others adapt to the changing world around us.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sports have always been a major part of my life, and basketball in particular has been my passion for as long as I can remember.
        At Trinity Bible College, I play on both the basketball and soccer teams, experiences that constantly push me to be my best self.
        Competing at this level has taught me discipline, leadership, and how to persevere through challenges.
        The lessons I’ve learned through sports go far beyond the scoreboard — they shape how I handle life every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of sports and school, I’ve developed a real interest in the stock market and investing.
        I’m fascinated by how the economy works, how trends shift, and how patience often pays off in ways that quick success never can.
        My long-term goal is to become fluent in trading and financial strategy — not just to benefit myself, but to help others build financial stability and confidence.
        To me, financial literacy is one of the most empowering skills anyone can learn.
      </p>

      <p>
        My family has always been the foundation of who I am.
        I have two brothers, a half-sister, and a dog named Leo who never fails to bring chaos and joy into the mix.
        Growing up with them taught me how to care for others, how to stay humble, and how to find humor in the messiness of life.
        No matter where life takes me, family will always be at the center of it all.
      </p>

      <p>
        One person who continues to inspire me is Stephen Curry — not just because of his talent, but because of how open he is about his Christian faith.
        His example reminds me that being successful doesn’t mean hiding what you believe in.
        In fact, standing firm in your beliefs while working hard is what truly defines character.
        That mindset motivates me to live with integrity, both on and off the court.
      </p>

      <p>
        My faith is the driving force behind everything I do.
        I’m a proud member of Bethlehem Lutheran Church, where I’ve found a supportive community that encourages spiritual and personal growth.
        Through faith, I’ve learned to trust the process even when the path isn’t clear.
        It’s what gives me peace, direction, and the confidence to take steps forward every single day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking ahead, I want to find ways to merge my skills in business, technology, and ministry to make a lasting impact.
        Whether that means leading a company, mentoring others, or starting something of my own, I want my work to have meaning.
        I believe that when you lead with purpose and stay rooted in faith, opportunities will align in ways you couldn’t have planned.
        That belief drives me to keep learning, growing, and serving wherever I’m called.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every day, I try to live with intention — giving thanks for what I have and striving to be a little better than the day before.
        Gratitude keeps me focused, and faith keeps me steady when things get uncertain.
        I’ve learned that growth doesn’t always happen fast, but it always happens with purpose.
        Wherever I’m headed, I trust that it’s exactly where I’m meant to be.
